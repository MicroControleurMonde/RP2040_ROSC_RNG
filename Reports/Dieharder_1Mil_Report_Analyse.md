### Analysis of ‘WEAK’ results in Dieharder tests :

1. **diehard_rank_32x32**

   - **p-value**: 0.99978142  
   - **Assessment**: WEAK
     
This test evaluates the rank matrix of 32x32 blocks. Although the p-value appears high (close to 1), this result indicates that the distribution of numbers seems insufficiently random or exhibits regularities for this specific test.

2. **sts_serial | 7**

   - **p-value**: 0.00177723  
   - **Assessment**: WEAK  

This test analyzes bit sequences over successive intervals. A p-value this low indicates a significant deviation from an ideal uniform distribution, suggesting that the generator might have structural or periodicity flaws in the bit sequence..

### Conclusion :
The two tests identified as **‘WEAK’** show that the random number generator has randomness problems. These weaknesses imply that the generator may not be entirely reliable for high-stakes applications that require strong randomness.
