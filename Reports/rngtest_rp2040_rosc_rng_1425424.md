# `rngtest` Results Analysis

### **FIPS 140-2 Test Results:**
   The `rngtest` ran several FIPS 140-2 tests to assess the quality of the generated numbers.

   - **FIPS 140-2 successes and failures:**
     ```
     rngtest: FIPS 140-2 successes: 0
     rngtest: FIPS 140-2 failures: 1000
     ```
     - This means that **all the FIPS tests failed**. A failure indicates that the generated sequence of numbers is not sufficiently random or does not meet certain expected statistical properties.

   - **Monobit Test:**
     ```
     rngtest: FIPS 140-2(2001-10-10) Monobit: 1000
     ```
     The **Monobit test** measures the number of bits equal to 1 in a binary sequence. If the number of bits equal to 1 is too high or too low, it may indicate a bias in the generation.
     Here, **all 1000 tests failed**.

   - **Poker Test:**
     ```
     rngtest: FIPS 140-2(2001-10-10) Poker: 1000
     ```
     The **Poker test** examines the distribution of bit subsequences. Here, it also failed 1000 times, which  indicates that the generated sequences are not sufficiently random or contain repeating patterns.

   - **Runs Test:**
     ```
     rngtest: FIPS 140-2(2001-10-10) Runs: 918
     ```
     The **Runs test** measures the length of consecutive equal bits. The failure of this test (918 failures)  indicates non-random dependencies in the generated sequence.

   - **Long Run:**
     ```
     rngtest: FIPS 140-2(2001-10-10) Long run: 1
     ```
     This test checks for long sequences of identical bits. It indicates that there was **1 occurrence** of a long sequence, which signals a lack of diversity in the generated bits.

### Conclusion:
The `rngtest` results show numerous failures on the FIPS 140-2 tests, meaning the binary file tested does not generate sufficiently random numbers or the sequence contains detectable patterns or biases.

Tests like **Monobit**, **Poker**, and **Runs** suggest that the sequence is far from random.
