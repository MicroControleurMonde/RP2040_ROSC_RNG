# Ent Report - 1.4 Million Values RP2040 RNG (ROSC)

### 1. **Value Frequencies (0 and 1)**:
   ```
   Value Char Occurrences Fraction
     0         24340416   0.533622
     1         21273152   0.466378
   Total:      45613568   1.000000
   ```
   - **Occurrences**: The binary file contains a total of 45,613,568 bits. Out of these, 24,340,416 are "0" and 21,273,152 are "1".
   - **Frequency**: The frequency of "0" is 53.36% and the frequency of "1" is 46.64%. The discrepancy is quite small, suggesting that the bits are fairly balanced, but there is a slight bias towards "0".

### 2. **Entropy**:
   ```
   Entropy = 0.996736 bits per bit.
   ```
   - Extremely close to 1, this indicates that the data is almost perfectly random, with a very slight regularity or predictability.

### 3. **Optimal Compression**:
   - No significant compression is possible.

### 4. **Chi-Square Test**:
   ```
   Chi square distribution for 45613568 samples is 206256.80, and randomly
   would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.
   ```
   - The Chi-square value (206256.80) is very high, but it is accompanied by a probability of exceeding this value of less than 0.01%. This very low probability suggests that the observed results are statistically significant.

### 5. **Arithmetic Mean of Bits**:
   ```
   Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.4664 (0.5 = random).
   ```
   - The mean of the bits is 0.4664, which is slightly lower than 0.5 (the expected value for perfectly random data). This is consistent with the slight predominance of "0" over "1" observed earlier in the report.

### 6. **Monte Carlo Pi Estimation**:
   ```
   Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.331954094 (error 6.06 percent).
   ```
   - The error of 6.06% is relatively high, which indicates that the RNG is not perfectly ideal, although it is still acceptable in certain contexts.

### 7. **Serial Correlation Coefficient**:
   ```
   Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000183 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
   ```
   - The coefficient of 0.000183 indicates that the bits are virtually uncorrelated.

### General Conclusion:
The data is almost perfectly random. The results are balanced between "0" and "1", the entropy is high, and there is almost no correlation between successive bits. 

**The random number generator used is of good quality**.
